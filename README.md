Project: 1911 Mod 1 Group Project

Group Member Names: Jeremiah, Cristina, Harry

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful? YES, you can still fully answer this question without knowing exactly what you're going to build.):  
-- Work time defaults to collaboration and project time. Communicate if you cannot make that work.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):  
-- Pair when we can. Implement the Driver Navigator roles.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:  
-- Stay in communication about everything. Setting up workflow in advance. Staying organized.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):  
-- Working together during project time.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):  
-- We will use slack for collaborating or discussing issues, if not in person.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
